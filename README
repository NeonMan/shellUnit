Shell Unit -- A testing framework for csh and bash-like shells.

Usage:
Shell Unit is invoked using the shunit executable, the command-line
parameters are as follows:

        shunit [TEST_FILE|TEST_DIRECTORY]

for example, running the tests contained in the file 'sampletest.shu' is:

        shunit sampletest.shu

If you need to run *all* the tests on a directory simply invoke shunit
with the directory as a parameter, it will run all the tests contained in
every .shu file. Example:

        shunit ./path/to/dir

Creating a test:
Shell Unit tests scripts by parsing and executting .shu files, which are
written in any of the supported unix shells (csh/bash). The test file
itself must load the script to be tested. Example.

#!/bin/bash
#sample.sh -- Script to be tested
function zero {
	return 0
}

#!/bin/bash
#sample.sh -- Test file fopr sample.sh
. sample.sh

function testZero {
	#Call function to be tested
	zero
	#Check return value
	assertEquals $? 0
}
